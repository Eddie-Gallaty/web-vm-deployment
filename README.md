# web-vm-deployment
Future state this will be a very basic front-end for rapid vm deployment based on pyvmomi and flask.

This is not even close to being done let alone presentable. Currently using this to bounce between PCs.

Under active development. If you have suggestions etc please fork and show me what you got!
